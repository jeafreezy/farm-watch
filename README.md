# Farm Watch


## Background

Farm watch is a farm/crop monitoring application for near real time analysis of a farmland using remote sensing data and geospatial tools. The overarching goal of this project is to explore how to harmonize different geospatial tools and libraries to build something that is innovative and useful.

Geospatial tools are released frequently, and keeping up with these tools can be daunting, especially for those without a geospatial background but with interest or ideas to innovate in the geospatial space. 

What does STAC means? I can explain. What does COGs mean? I know it. But, what have I used it for? Nothing, yet :(. This is why I want to build this product to explore how to combine these tools together and to showcase the possibilities around application of geospatial & remote sensing data and technology for food security/SDG2.

This project has 3 objectives:

1. To strenghthen my knowledge of these tools
2. To build something useful and innovative using these tools
3. To let people know the possibilties and how to combine several geospatial tools together to solve problems in their domain of interest.
4. To build upon the skills I have learned while building [**Spatialnode**](https://spatialnode.net). Never stop learning!

## Timeline

Due to busy schedules and other engagements, this might take me a while. But I am envisaging about 3 months for this because I don't want to rush and I want to ensure I understand every underlying concepts deeply!
